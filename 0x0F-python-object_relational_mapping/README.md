#   0. Get all states

Write a script that lists all `states` from the database `hbtn_0e_0_usa`:

*   Your script should take 3 arguments: `mysql username`, `mysql password` and `database name` (no argument validation needed)
*   You must use the module `MySQLdb` (`import MySQLdb`)
*   Your script should connect to a MySQL server running on `localhost` at port `3306`
*   Results must be sorted in ascending order by `states.id`
*   Results must be displayed as they are in the example below
*   Your code should not be executed when imported



#   1. Filter states

Write a script that lists all `states` with a `name` starting with `N` (upper N) from the database `hbtn_0e_0_usa`:

*   Your script should take 3 arguments: `mysql username`, `mysql password` and `database name` (no argument validation needed)
*   You must use the module `MySQLdb` (`import MySQLdb`)
*   Your script should connect to a MySQL server running on `localhost` at port `3306`
*   Results must be sorted in ascending order by `states.id`
*   Results must be displayed as they are in the example below
*   Your code should not be executed when imported
